### Hi, I am Tharmarajan 👋 IGN Tin Tin

> Code is like humor. When you have to explain it, it’s bad.

- 🔭 I’m making algorithms dance on the screen with my [Algorithm Visualizer](https://algorithmvisualizer.in/) project—watch them solve, sort, and search!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React aka bending the DOM to my will with React magic!
- 👯‍♂️ Ready to team up on projects that are as fun to build as they are to use! Let’s make something awesome 😎 together!
- 🍪 Currently accepting snacks… but would also take a job offer!
- 💬 Ask me about coding, problem-solving, or anything that might break my brain 🤯 (in a good way)!
- 📫 Carrier pigeons welcome, but email or LinkedIn might be quicker!
